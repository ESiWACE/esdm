abstract="Many scientific applications are limited by the performance offered by parallel file systems. SSD based burst buffers provide significant better performance than HDD backed storage but at the expense of capacity. Clearly, achieving wire-speed of the interconnect and predictable low latency I/O is the holy grail of storage. In-memory storage promises to provide optimal performance exceeding SSD based solutions. Kove®'s XPD® offers pooled memory for cluster systems. This remote memory is asynchronously backed up to storage devices of the XPDs and considered to be non-volatile. Albeit the system offers various APIs to access this memory such as treating it as a block device, it does not allow to expose it as file system that offers POSIX or MPI-IO semantics.",

abstract = {Abstract We evaluate the new icosahedral nonhydrostatic atmospheric (ICON-A) general circulation model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology that is flexible to be run at grid spacings from a few tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers. A simulation with ICON-A at a low resolution (160 km) is compared to a not-tuned fourfold higher-resolution simulation (40 km). Simulations using the last release of the ECHAM climate model (ECHAM6.3) are also presented at two different resolutions. The ICON-A simulations provide a compelling representation of the climate and its variability. The climate of the low-resolution ICON-A is even slightly better than that of ECHAM6.3. Improvements are obtained in aspects that are sensitive to the representation of orography, including the representation of cloud fields over eastern-boundary currents, the latitudinal distribution of cloud top heights, and the spatial distribution of convection over the Indian Ocean and the Maritime Continent. Precipitation over land is enhanced, in particular at high-resolution ICON-A. The response of precipitation to El Niño sea surface temperature variability is close to observations, particularly over the eastern Indian Ocean. Some parameterization changes lead to improvements, for example, with respect to rain intensities and the representation of equatorial waves, but also imply a warmer troposphere, which we suggest leads to an unrealistic poleward mass shift. Many biases familiar to ECHAM6.3 are also evident in ICON-A, namely, a too zonal SPCZ, an inadequate representation of north hemispheric blocking, and a relatively poor representation of tropical intraseasonal variability.},
