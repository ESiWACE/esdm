\section{Data model}%
\label{data-model}
%While datatypes introduced by computer architectures and software libraries are important for the data model, they are discussed separately in \eb{Reference}.

The data model of a system organizes elements of data, standardizes how they represent data entities and how users can interact with the data.
The \textbf{model} can be split into three layers:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \textbf{conceptual data} model describes the entities and the semantics of the domain that are represented by the data model and the typical operations to manipulate the data. 
    In our case, the scientific domain is numerical weather prediction and climate.
  \item The \textbf{logical data model} describes the abstraction level provided by the system, how domain entities are mapped to objects provided by the system\footnote{A entity of the domain model such as a car could be mapped to one or several objects.}, and the supported operations to access and manipulate these objects are defined.
    Importantly, the \textbf{logical data model} defines the semantics when using the operations to access and manipulate the system objects.
    For example, a system object of a relational model is a table -- representing attributes of a set of objects -- and a row of a table representing attributes of a single object.
  \item The physical data model describes how the logical entities are finally mapped to objects/files/regions on available hardware. 
    The physical data model is partly covered by the backends of ESDM, therefore, the descriptions will stop at that abstraction level.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conceptual data model}

Our conceptual data model is aligned with the needs of domain scientists from climate and weather. 
It reuses and extends from concepts introduced in a data model proposed for the Climate and Forecasting conventions for NetCDF data~\cite{gmd-10-4619-2017}.

\paragraph{Variable:}%
\label{variable}

A variable, \(V\), defines a set of data representing a discrete (generally scalar) quantity discretised within a ``sampling'' domain, \(d\). It is accompanied by metadata.

\paragraph{Metadata:}%
\label{metadata}

Which will include at the minimum, a name, but may also include units, and information about additional dimensionality, directly (e.g.~via a key, value pair such as that necessary to expose \(z=1.5m\) for air temperature at 1.5m) or indirectly (e.g.~via pointers to other generic coordinate variables which describe the sampled domain). 
There may also be a dictionary of additional metadata which may or may not conform to an external semantic convention or standard. 
Such metadata could include information about the tool used to observe or simulate the specific variable. 
Additional metadata is also required for all the other entities described below.

\paragraph{Dimension:}%
\label{dimension}

The sampling domain \(d\) is defined by dimensions which define an a coordinate axis. 
Dimensions will also include metadata, which must again, include at a minimum a name (e.g.~height, time), but may also include information about directionality, units (e.g.~degrees, months, days-since-a-particular-time-using-a-particular-calendar), or details of how to construct an algorithm to find the actual sampling coordinates, perhaps using a well known algorithm such as an ISO 8601 time.

\paragraph{Coordinate:}%
\label{coordinate}

Coordinates are the set of values at which data is sampled along any given dimension. 
They may be explicitly defined by indexing into a coordinate variable, or implicitly defined by an algorithm. 
When we talk about the coordinates, it is usually clear if we mean the N-dimensional coordinate to address data in a given variable or if we just mean the (1D) coordinate along one dimension.

\paragraph{Cell:}%
\label{cell}

The data values are known at points, which may or may not represent a cell. 
Such cells are n-dimensional shapes where the dimensionality may or may not fully encompass the dimensionality of the domain.
n-dimensional shapes can be implicitly defined in which case the Cartesian product of all dimensional coordinates forms the data "cube" of the cell, but they can also be explicitly defined, either by providing bounds on the coordinate variables (via metadata) or by introducing a new variable which explicitly defines the functional boundaries of the cell (as might happen in a finite element unstructured
grid).

\paragraph{Dataset:}%
\label{dataset}

Variables can be aggregated into datasets. 
A dataset contains multiple variables that logically belong together, and should be associated with metadata describing the reason for the aggregation. 
Variables must have unique names within a dataset.

Our conceptual model assumes that all variables are scalars, but clearly to make use of these scalars requires more complex interpretation. 
In particular, we need to know the datype and operators.
%\eb{Fix this}

\paragraph{Datatype:}%
\label{datatype}

defines the types of values that are valid and the operations that can be conducted. 
While we are mostly dealing with scalars, they may not be amenable to interpretation as simple numbers. 
For example, a variable may be storing an integer which points into a taxonomy of categories of land-surface-types. 
More complex structures could include complex data types such as vectors, compressed ensemble values, or structures within this system, provided such interpretation is handled outside of the ESDM, and documented in metadata. 
This allows us to limit ourselves to simple data types plus arbitrary length blocks of bits.

\paragraph{Operators:}%
\label{operators}

define the manipulations possible on the conceptual entities.
The simplest operators will include creation, read, update and delete applied to an entity as a whole, or to a subset, however even these simple operators will come with constraints, for example, it should not be possible to delete a coordinate variable without deleting the parent variable as well.
There will need to be a separation of concerns between operators which can be handled within the ESDM subsystem, and those which require external logic.
Operators which might require external logic could include subsetting --- it will be seen that the ESDM will support simple subsetting using simple coordinates --- but complex subsets such as finding a region in real space from dimensions spanned using an algorithm or coordinate variable, may require knowledge of how such algorithms or variables are specified.
Such knowledge is embedded in conventions such as the CF NetCDF conventions, and this knowledge could only be provided to the ESDM via appropriate operator plugins.
 
\subsection{Logical data model}

The logical data model describes how data is represented inside ESDM, the operations to interact with the data and their semantics.
There are four first class entities in the ESDM logical data model: \textbf{variable}s, \textbf{fragment}s, \textbf{container}s, and \textbf{metadata}.
ESDM entities may be linked by ESDM \textbf{reference}s, and a key property which emerges from the use of references is that no ESDM entity instance may be deleted while references to it still exist.
The use of reference counting will ensure this property as well as avoid dangling pointers.
 
%gives an overview of the logical data model.
%\eb{Fix this}

Each of these entities is now described, along with a list of supported operations:

\paragraph{Variable:}%
\label{variable-1}

In the logical data model, the variable corresponds directly to a variable in the conceptual data model.
Each element of the variable sampled across the dimensions contains data with a prescribed \textbf{DataType}.
Variables are associated with both \textbf{Scientific Metadata} and \textbf{Technical Metadata}.
Variables are partitioned into \textbf{fragments} each of which can be stored on one or more ``storage backend''.
A variable definition includes internal information about the domain (bounding box in some coordinate system) and dimensionality (size and shape), while the detailed information about which coordinate variables are needed to span the dimensions and how they are defined is held in the technical metadata.
Similarly, where a variable is itself a coordinate variable, a link to the parent variable for which it is used is held in the technical metadata.
The ESDM will not allow an attempt to delete a variable to succeed while any such references exist (see references).
A key part of the variable definition is the list of fragments associated with it, and if possible, how they are organised to span the domain.
Users may choose to submit code pieces that are then run within the I/O-path (not part within ESiWACE implementation), such an operation covers the typical filter, map and reduce operations of the data flow programming paradigm.
 
Fragments are created by the backend while appending/modifying data to a variable.

Operations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Variables can be created and deleted.
  \item Fragments of data can be attached and deleted.
  \item Fragments can be repartitioned and reshuffled.
  \item Integrity can be checked.
  \item Data can be read, appended or modified those operations will be translated to the responsible fragments.
  \item Metadata can be atomically attached to a variable or modified.
  \item A variable can be sealed to make it immutable for all subsequent modifications.
  \item Process data of the variable somewhere in the I/O-path.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Fragment:}%
\label{fragment}

A fragment is a piece (subdomain) of a variable.
The ESDM expects to handle fragments as atomic entities, that is, only one process can write a fragment through the ESDM, and the ESDM will write fragments as atomic entities to storage backends.
The backends are free to further partition these fragments in an appropriate way, for example, by sharding using chunks as described in the mapping section.
However, the ESDM is free to replicate fragments or subsets of fragments and to choose which backend is appropriate for any given fragment.
This allows, for example, the ESDM to split a variable into fragments some of which are on stored on a parallel file system, while others are placed in object storage.
 
Operations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Data of fragments can be read, appended or modified.
  \item Integrity of the fragment can be checked.
  \item Process data of the variable somewhere in the I/O-path.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Container:}%
\label{container}

A container is a virtual entity providing views on collections of variables, allowing multiple different datasets (as defined in the conceptual model) to be realised over the variables visible to the ESDM.
Each container provides a hierarchical namespace holding references to one or multiple variables together with metadata.
Variables cannot be deleted while they are referenced by a container.
The use of these dynamic containers provides support for much more flexible organisation of data than provided by a regular file system semantics --- and efficiently support high level applications such as the Data Reference Syntax~\cite{drs2012}.
 
A container provides the ESDM storage abstraction which is analogous to an external file.
Because many scientific metadata conventions are based on semantic structures which span variables within a file in ways that may be opaque to the ESDM without the use of a plugin, the use of a container can indicate to the ESDM that these variables are linked even though the ESDM does not understand why, and so they cannot be independently deleted.
When entire files in NetCDF format are ingested into the ESDM, the respective importing tool must create a container to ensure such linking properties are not lost.
 
Operations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Creation and deletion of containers.
  \item Creation and deletion of names in the hierarchical name space; the creation of links to an existing variable.
  \item Attaching and modification of metadata.
  \item Integrity can be checked.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Metadata:}%
\label{metadata-1}

Can be associated with all the other first class entities (variables, fragments, and containers). Such metadata is split into internal ESDM technical metadata, and external user-supplied semantic metadata.

Technical metadata covers, e.g., permissions, information about data location and timestamps.
A backend will be able to add its own metadata to provide the information to lookup the data for the fragment from the storage backend managed by it.
Metadata by itself is treaded like a normal ESDM variable but linked to the variable of choice.
The implementation may embed (simple) metadata into fragments of original data (see Reference).
 
Operations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Users can create, read, or delete arbitrary scientific metadata onto variables and containers. A future version of the ESDM may support user scientific metadata for fragments.
  \item Container level metadata is generally not directly associated with variables, but may be retrieved via following references from variables to containers.
  \item Queries allow to search for arbitrary metadata, e.g., for objects that have (\texttt{experiment=X}, \texttt{model=Y}, \texttt{time=yesterday}) returning the variables and containers in a list that match. This enables to locate scientific data in an arbitrary namespace.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Reference:}%
\label{reference}

A reference is a link between entities and can be used in many places, references can be embedded instead of real data of these logical objects.
For example, dimensions inside a variable can be references, also a container typically uses references to variables.
 
Operations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A reference can be created from existing logical entities or removed.
\end{itemize}

%  \caption{Logical Data Model (TODO)}%
%  \label{fig:data-model}
%\end{figure}

\paragraph{Namespace:}%
\label{namespace}

ESDM does not offer a simple hierarchical namespace for the files.
It provides the elementary functions to navigate data: teleportation and orientation in the following fashion: Queries about semantical data properties (e.g., \texttt{experiment=myExperiment}, \texttt{model=myModel}, \texttt{date=yesterday}) can be performed returning a list of matching files with their respective metadata.
Iterating the list (orientation) is similar to listing a directory in a file system.
 
Note that this reduces the burden to define a hierarchical namespace and for data sharing services based on scientific metadata.
An input/output container for an application can be assembled on-the-fly by using queries and name the resulting entities.
As a container provides a hierachical namespace, by harnessing this capability one can search for relevant variables and map them into the local file system tree, accessing these variables as if they would be, e.g., NetCDF files.
By offering a FUSE client, this feature also enables backwards compatibility for legacy POSIX applications.
